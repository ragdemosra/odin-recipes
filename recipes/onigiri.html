    <h3>steps to make</h3>
    <ol class="instructions-list">
      <li>
        once the rice is cooked and cooled down, all you have to do is shape
        them. i have a difficult time with this, so what i’ve learned to do is
        use some plastic wrap. put a scoop of rice in the middle of the plastic
        wrap and wrap it up.
      </li>
      <li>
        now, the shaping. hold the wrapped up rice in your hand. cup your hand
        so it looks like a “U”, and then cup your other hand, perpendicularly,
        on top of it tightly. gently squeeze the rice. if you’re doing it
        correctly, it should start to look kind of like a triangle. then, rotate
        the rice ball in your hands, so a different point is pointing downward
        and repeat.
      </li>
      <li>
        take the rice out of the plastic wrap and form it a few times with your
        bare hands. Then place it on a plate, and sprinkle some salt on them.
      </li>

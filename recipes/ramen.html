      when I was big into naruto, those hot steaming bowls of ramen seemed like
      the absolute perfect meal. however, back then, i didnâ€™t understand the
      difference between those, and what came out of top ramen packets.
    </p>

    <h3>ingredients</h3>
    <ul class="ingredients-list">
      <li>top ramen</li>
      <li>5 cups beef broth</li>
      <li>pork tenderloin</li>
      <li>2 eggs</li>
      <li>1 baby bok choy</li>
      <li>1 green onion</li>
      <li>soy sauce</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>steps to make</h3>
    <ol class="instructions-list">
      <li>
        marinate the tenderloin for at least 3 hours. you can use just soy
        sauce, or a mixure of whatever other asian sauces you want. teriyaki
        would be good, as would some mirin.
      </li>
      <li>
        preheat your oven to 450, then cook the tenderloin for 12-15 minutes, or
        until cooked all the way through.
      </li>
      <li>
        put your eggs in a pot with enough water to cover them. bring to a boil
        and cover with a lid. It should take about 10 minutes to hard boil the
        eggs. then pull them out and put them into a bowl of cold water to cool.
      </li>
      <li>
        while this is happening, pour or mix the stock/broth in a pot and bring
        it to a simmer. you can add soy sauce or mirin to taste.
      </li>
      <li>
        once simmering, add the Top Ramen noodles. do NOT add in the flavor
        packets. let that cook.
      </li>
      <li>
        now, we cut up all the toppings! peel the eggs and slice them in half,
        cut the pork, kamaboko, bok choy, aburage, and green onion into thin
        slices.
      </li>
      <li>
        serve up the noodles and broth in a nice deep bowl, then place all the
        ingredients in groups on top, and add in a few small rectangles of nori.
        itadakimasu!
